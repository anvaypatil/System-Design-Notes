## Basic File System Basics
- A structure defined over raw storage space; raw storage space is Hard Disk, SSD etc. 
- It is made of: Metadata + Data; for efficient storage and access. 


### An Inode
The inode (index node) is a data structure in a Unix-style file system that describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory. Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data.

An Inode number points to an Inode. An Inode is a data structure that stores the following information about a file:
- Mode/permission (protection)
- Owner ID
- Group ID
- Size of file
- Number of **hard links** to the file. (hard link is a directory entry that associates a name with a file)
- Time last accessed
- Time last modified
- Time inode last modified
- File protection flags
- Pointers to the blocks storing fileâ€™s contents | Disk Address

**Name** is not part of inode.

- **Hard Link**

- **Soft Link**


- Since in Linux, directory is a file as well. So even for directory there is inode.
- Directory is a file which contains a table of inode to file-name mapping.
