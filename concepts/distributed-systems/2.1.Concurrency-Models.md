## Concurrency models
1. #### Threads and Locks
    - Eg: Thread class, synchronized, java.util.concurrent.locks, Exceutors
1. #### Atomic & Thread-local
    - Eg: atomic operations, Compare And Swap techniques (CAS), Software Transactional Memory, Clojure collections
1. #### Functional Programming
    - Eg: Streams and Lamba, RxJava
1. #### Actors
    - Eg: concepts of postbox, actors, Erlang Approach, Akka Framework
1. #### Communicating Sequential Process
    - Eg: Go Routines
1. #### Data Parallism
    - Eg: GPU parallelism, Image processing, machine learning computations algorithms, vector computing for graphics
1. #### Map Reduce
    - Eg: divide & conquer of data, Hadoop, Spark Framework
1. #### Event Driven
    - **Single Theaded**: Eg: Vertx Framework, Node.js
    - **Multi-threaded**: Eg: CompleteableFutures in java, Kafka Framework
1. #### Grid Computing
    - Eg: Apache Ignite, Hazalcast



### Why so many models?
#### Shared Mutable State
- **Shared**: Data storage that is used by *more than one thread*
    - if the data is not shared across threads, then there is no concurrency problem
    - Unshared is thread local state, and sequential programming
- **Mutable**: Data storage that is *updated* at some point with new data
    - if the data item doesn't need changing, there is no concurency problem.
    - Immutable data structures are good, they can be passed across threads without any problems.
- **State**: Data storage with data
    - No stateful computation is like executing pure function across core's or machines.
