### Parallel Vs Distributed Computing
- Parallel Computing can mean:
    - Vector processing of data
    - Multiple CPUs in a single computer
- Distributed Computing is multiple CPU's across many computers over the network

### Concepts and Definations
- Any Memory that can be used by multiple threads must have a associated *synchronization syste*
- **Semaphores**: A semaphore is a flag that can be raised or lowerd in one step. 
    - They were used by railroad engineers to flag a train entering a shared track. 
    - `lock()` and `unlock()` fn's to be used. Calls to `lock()` when a semaphore is already locked cause the thread to block.
    - *Pitfall*: Must "bind" semaphores to the particular objects: must remeber to unlock correctly.
