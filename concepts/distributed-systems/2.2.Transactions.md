### Transaction basics:

#### ACID property
- **Atomic**: means a txn must either be a commit or rollback all updates as a single unit of work.
- **Consistency**: means during the course of the txn, the resource will not be left in an inconsistent state.
- **Isolation**: During the course of the txn, intermittent status of various participants is not visible to the external world.
- **Durability**: means when the txn is committed, then it is guaranteed that the txn is complete and the resource updates are permanent.

#### BASE property
> **B**asically **A**vailable, **S**oft state, **E**ventual consistency
- **Basically available** indicates that the system does guarantee availability, in terms of the CAP theorem.
- **Soft state** indicates that the state of the system may change over time, even without input. This is because of the eventual consistency model.
- **Eventual consistency** indicates that the system will become consistent over time, given that the system doesn't receive input during that time.
