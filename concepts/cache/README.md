## Cache
 A software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.  A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot. 

## Type of cache polices
 Caching improves performance by keeping recent or often-used data items in memory locations that are faster or computationally cheaper to access than normal memory stores. When the cache is full, the algorithm must choose which items to discard to make room for the new ones.
